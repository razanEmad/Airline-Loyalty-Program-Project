# Airline-Loyalty-Program-Project
Airline Loyalty Program Analysis

Project Overview:
This project was completed as part of our internship at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI). The goal was to analyze an airline loyalty program dataset to uncover insights about member behaviors, flight activities, and loyalty trends. Our team focused on attributes like age, flight history, loyalty program tiers, and spending habits to provide actionable insights for the airline.

Dataset Information:
The dataset contains information about airline loyalty program members, including:

Member ID: Unique identifier
FFP Date: Date joined the frequent flyer program
First Flight Date: Date of the member's first flight
Age, Gender
Flight Count: Total number of flights
Total Distance: Distance flown (km)
Points: Bonus points accumulated
Yearly Spend: Spending in two specific years

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Using Python and Power Query, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, addressing issues like:

Handling missing values (e.g., filling missing ages with the mean)
Removing duplicates to ensure data accuracy
Renaming unclear columns for better readability
Correcting data types for accurate analysis

Visualizations:
Using Power BI, we visualized key trends and patterns:
Age Group Distribution: Bar charts categorized travelers by age group, providing demographic insights.
Flight Trends Over Time: Line charts showed how flight distances and counts evolved.
Geographic Insights: A map highlighted frequent flyer activity across countries.
Points Accumulation: Scatter plots revealed the correlation between age and total points earned.
Gender & Tier Representation: Pie charts and donut charts showcased the gender breakdown and distribution across loyalty program tiers.
Flight Frequency: Gauge charts illustrated travelers' progress toward flight targets.
Key Findings
Age Trends: We observed distinct travel behaviors across age groups, which can help airlines tailor marketing strategies to specific demographics.
Geographic Insights: Certain regions exhibited higher traveler activity, indicating opportunities for airline expansion.
Points & Engagement: A clear connection between age and points earned suggests that targeted promotions could enhance member engagement.
Flight Frequency: Seasonal trends in flight frequency and intervals between flights were identified, allowing the airline to optimize loyalty program incentives.
